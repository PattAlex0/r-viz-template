# Create a plain plot

I use the built in `mtcars` dataset to build a basic scatterplot

```{r scatter-basic}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
```

## Change colour

```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp,
     col = "dodgerblue1")
```

## Change symbols 

```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp,
     col = "dodgerblue1",
     cex = 16)
```
